Learning how to implement and use Vuex 4 in a Vue 3 project (Pluralsight tut)

# Notes
- State management in this tut will be used only with shared state
- "If you don't need to share it, don't"
- Flux like state management, but simplier
  - Single Vuex Store as the single source of truth
  - Vue Conponents -> *Dispatch -> Actions -> *Commit -> Mutation -> *Update -> State
